# Windows BIOS Reboot Helper

**IMPORTANT:** It is not technically possible for a script to automatically reboot a PC into a legacy BIOS setup screen.

This script is a helper that will:
1.  Display a warning and remind you of common BIOS keys (`Del`, `F2`, `F10`, etc.).
2.  Perform a standard reboot after a 15-second countdown.

## How to Use
1.  Right-click the `reboot_bios_helper.bat` file.
2.  Select **"Run as administrator"**.
3.  Read the instructions in the command window and be prepared to press your computer's BIOS key as soon as it restarts.
