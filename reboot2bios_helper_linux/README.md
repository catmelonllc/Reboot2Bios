# Linux BIOS Reboot Helper

**IMPORTANT:** It is not technically possible for a script to automatically reboot a Linux machine into a legacy BIOS setup screen.

This script is a helper that will:
1.  Display a warning and remind you of common BIOS keys.
2.  Perform a standard reboot after a 10-second countdown.

## How to Use
1.  Make the script executable: `chmod +x reboot_bios_helper.sh`
2.  Run the script: `./reboot_bios_helper.sh`
3.  Read the instructions and be prepared to press your computer's BIOS key as soon as it restarts.
